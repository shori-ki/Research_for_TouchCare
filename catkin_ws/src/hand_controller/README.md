## README for servo motor serial communication

Feb 8, 2018:

The serial communication with the regular Arduino is for some reason ridiculously slow. For now, the only workaround we found is sending the raw string via echo through the serial port. However, starting up the ROS node sets the serial port up incorrectly, and I cannot find where that happens. 

The makeshift solution: Start up the ROS nodes. Afterwards, start up "minicom" and set up the serial port correctly.

Short manual for Minicom: Press Ctrl-A, then Z. Then Ctrl-A, then O. Select "Serial port setup". Change the device name to the port that you want to configure (the arduino port), and the "E - Bps/par/bits" line to say "9600 8N1". Then (important), press Ctrl-A, then Q, to "leave without reset". That leaves the port settings intact.

You can also save those settings as a file somehow.

## Synopsis
Serial communication with something

## Code Example / How To Use
- Change permissions (if necessary)  
 $ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0  
- Launch  
 $ roslaunch tnp_serial_com TSC.launch   

## ROS Topic
- The device inputs from ROS(PC)  
-- */write* (std_msg/String)  
- The device outputs to ROS(PC)  
-- */read* (std_msg/String)  

## Other notes
Please rewrite TSC.launch (if necessary).  

## About port number
If we use *'/dev/ttyACMX'*, we will get confused.  
Please type and check  
 $ ls /dev/serial/by-id/  
and use *'/dev/serial/by-id/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'*  

## Current usage example: End effector control
### ROS Topic
- send command to Arduino  
-- */tnp_arduino/write*  
- receive end effector's status from Arduino  
-- */tnp_arduino/read*  

### Command
The strings to be passed are in the format `set 1XXXXXX YYYY ZZ`.  
where `1XXXXXX` is controls the mechanisms:  
From the leftmost bit,  
* 1st bit: '1'
* 2nd bit: Gripper (Close'1' / Open'0')
* 3rd bit: Suction (On'1' / Off'0')
* 4th bit: Gripper Liner Actuator (Advance'1' / Retract'0')
* 5th bit: Suction Liner Actuator (Advance'1' / Retract'0')
* 6th bit: Drawer (Open'1' / Close'0' / Shake'2')  <
* 7th bit: Blower (On'1' / Off'0')

where `YYYY` is gripper parameter:
* Gripper open: Certain width (milimeters,0~110)
* Gripper close: Gripping force (millinewton?,0~1500)

where `ZZ` is gripper parameter:
* Suction force (kPa, 0~40)

### Meaning of Hand Status Signal

Status 1XXXXXXXXXXX  
where `1XXXXXXXXXXX` is  
From the leftmost bit,  
* 1st bit: '1'
* 2nd bit: Gripper (1:Close / 0:Open)
* 3rd bit: Suction (1:On / 0:Off)
* 4th bit: Gripper Liner Actuator (1:Advance / 0:Retract)
* 5th bit: Suction Liner Actuator (1:Advance / 0:Retract)
* 6th bit: Drawer (1:Open / 0:Close)
* 7th bit: Blower (1:On / 0:Off)
* 8th bit: Grip task status (1:Grip Something / 0:Grip Nothing)
* 9th bit: Suction task status (1:Suction Something / 0:Suction Nothing)
* 10th bit: Gripper Contact Detect (1:Contact Something / 0:Contact Nothing)
* 11th bit: Suction Contact Detect (1:Contact Something / 0:Contact Nothing)
* 12th bit: Drawer stucked (1:Stucked / 0:Clear)



## Current usage example: SR300 shutter control
### ROS Topic
- send command to Arduino  
-- */tnp_arduino_shutter/write*  

### Command
Please publish "set 0 XX" to the topic.  
XX is 0~31 (It is 5 bit binary number)  
- For example:  
-- "set 0 0"  -> All shutter open   
-- "set 0 31" -> All shutter close  
-- "set 0 1"  -> Shutter1 close and other shutter open  
-- "set 0 18" -> Shutter2 and shutter5 close and other shutter open
